        'I built the custom phrase input, and made the call to open create and import in a full browser tab instead of the 360-pixel popup — key material deserves room to breathe.',
      tech: "The grid is a `react-hook-form` `useFieldArray`. A cell turns red only when it is non-empty and missing from the BIP39 `wordlist_en.json` set — a membership test, never a network call. Paste splits on spaces and distributes across the remaining cells.",

      contribution:
        'I owned the search surface and the tuning call: threshold 0.1 on purpose, plus a multi-token $and query so "usd coin" narrows instead of widening.',
      tech: 'Search is `fuse.js` configured in `utils/fuse.ts` with `threshold: 0.1` and `includeScore`. The query is rebuilt as an `$and` of tokens, each an OR across the keys, then results sort by score. It runs over an already-live array — never a fetch per keystroke.',

      tech: "The channel name is literally `'0x' + puzzleHash`, so each wallet listens only on its own hash. `Ably.tsx` is a try/catch around `useChannel` that returns an empty fragment — a dropped socket logs and the UI stays up.",

      tech: 'A request crosses three contexts. The injected script exposes `window.chia.hoogii`; the background enforces a fixed gate order — `IS_VALID_WALLET` → `IS_LOCK` → `IS_CONNECTED` — before forwarding. `signCoinSpends` raises the popup, which renders the spend bundle as an expandable tree via react-json-view-lite.',
