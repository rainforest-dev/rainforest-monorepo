## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/demo/: components specific for blog posts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro: base layout component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ resume.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
