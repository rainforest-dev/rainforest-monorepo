## Positioning the Indicator

To position the indicator correctly, we need to calculate its left and right positions relative to the container.
This is done by calculating the percentage of the temperature values within the lower and upper bounds.

$$
left = \frac{tempMin - lowerBound}{upperBound - lowerBound}
$$

$$
right = \frac{tempMax - lowerBound}{upperBound - lowerBound}
$$

and the indicator is positioned using CSS:

```css
.indicator {
  position: absolute;
  left: calc(v-bind(left) * 100%);
  right: calc((1 - v-bind(right)) * 100%);
}
```

## Visualizing Temperature Ranges

The gradient background visualizes temperature ranges, transitioning from cool to warm colors.
The "from" and "to" endpoints represent the positions correlating with the lower and upper bounds of
these temperatures. As the temperature approaches the lower bound, it shifts towards cooler hues like teal,
indicating a smaller proportion of warm color in the mix. Conversely, as the temperature nears the upper bound,
it transitions to warmer tones such as amber, reflecting an increased presence of warm colors.
This effect is implemented using the `color-mix` function in CSS, which allows for blending colors
based on these position ratios relative to the bounds.

$$
warmness = \frac{temp - lowerBound}{upperBound - lowerBound}
$$

```css
.indicator {
  --color-source-from: var(--color-teal-500);
  --color-source-to: var(--color-amber-300);
  --color-from: color-mix(
    in oklab,
    var(--color-source-from),
    var(--color-source-to) calc(v-bind(left) * 100%)
  );
  --color-to: color-mix(
    in oklab,
    var(--color-source-from),
    var(--color-source-to) calc(v-bind(right) * 100%)
  );
  @apply bg-gradient-to-r from-(--color-from) to-(--color-to);
}
```
